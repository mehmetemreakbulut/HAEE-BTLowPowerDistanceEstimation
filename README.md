This code can be use to verify that the nrf environnement has been set up correctly and that that we can flash the board.

This code allow to turn on/off the led 0 to 3 of the board by pressing the button 0 to 3 to verify that the board has been flashed correctly

## Low Power Distance Estimation: Bluetooth RSSI and Channel Sounding

This project explores methods for estimating distance using Bluetooth and microcontroller technologies, with a comparative analysis of approaches such as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and Sounding Channel techniques. The objective is to evaluate whether recent advancements in Bluetooth technology can offer a reliable and accurate alternative for distance measurement.

We use the device nRF54L15 for this project.
