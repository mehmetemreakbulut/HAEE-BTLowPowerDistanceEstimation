## Low Power Distance Estimation: Bluetooth RSSI and Channel Sounding

This project explores methods for estimating distance using Bluetooth and microcontroller technologies, with a comparative analysis of approaches such as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and Sounding Channel techniques. The objective is to evaluate whether recent advancements in Bluetooth technology can offer a reliable and accurate alternative for distance measurement.

We use the device nRF54L15 for this project.
